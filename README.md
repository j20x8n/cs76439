DESIGNING A ROLLER COASTER
This activity explores the   interaction of functions   in developing   a   roller   coaster.
Design Brief 
The task for the   investigation   is to design a track   for   a   roller   coaster.
Part 1 
A   roller coaster   requires that a series   of functions   be fitted   together, with a starting and finishing   gradient   for   each section that   matches that of another function.
One section of the track   is to   be given   as   a   parabola that   meets the following conditions:
•            it   has an   initial slope   on the   ascent   as   0.7
•            it   has a final slope   on the   descent   as   -1.8
•          the origin   is   located at   the   beginning   of   the   initial   slope.
•          the   horizontal distance   between the final   and   initial   slope   is   16   m. 

Find a   parabola that   meets this   requirement.
For the track to   be smooth there can’t   be   abrupt   changes   in direction. There will   be two   linear segments at either   end   of the   parabola, L1    and   L2, such   that   there   is   a   smooth   transition at the transition   points   P and Q. Therefore, you want   the   linear segments to   be tangents at these   points. 


Find the equations of the   linear   segments.
Part 2 
Complete a design for a   roller coaster   using   appropriate   functions   (which   may   include,   but   is   not   limited   to, Polynomials,   Exponentials and Trigonometric). You will   need to   pay   particular attention to   ensure that   the   trolley   is able to   run smoothly over the track. You are   required   to   include   the   functions   that   you   found   in   Part   1,   although   you   may translate   it to a different   position   if you wish   (show evidence). 
Some additional factors that you   may   like to consider:
•          The   practicality of your   Roller Coaster   (including   length   and   height   constraints)
•          It   may   be worth   looking   at   information   about   roller   coasters,   and then   using   that   as   a   reference   to   consider   strengths,   limitations, etc
•          using software   like   Geogebra   or   similar to   draw   a   diagram   of   your   track
At the conclusion, you are to   submit the following:
•          A diagram of your track,   showing   each   function   with   its   domain.
•            Evidence that your track   is smooth
•          A discussion as to   the   practicality   of the   track,   considering   any   limitations   that   you   needed   to   deal   with.
Folio Tasks:   Report Writing Guidelines

•         Conclusions,   interpretations and/or arguments that are   required for the   assessment   must   be   presented   in the   report,   and   not   in   an appendix.
•         Appendices should only   be   used to support the   report, and   should   not form   part   of the   assessment   decision.
Language Conventions 
•         Written sections   (Introduction  Conclusion)   must   include
o   appropriate   paragraphing
o   full sentences with correct grammar and   structure
•         Whenever   possible the   use of “I”,   “me”,   “we” should   be avoided.
The Structure of a Mathematical Report
Introduction
This section describes what the investigation will be about. It should include: 
•          any   background   (set the scene)   information   relevant to the   main focus of the   investigation
•          the aim/purpose of the   investigation   (including the definition of   any   key   terms   (mathematical   and   non-mathematical)   relevant   to   the   context   of the   problem)
•          a description of   how the   investigation will   be   carried   out
Mathematical   Investigations  Analysis
This section contains all the data/information/calculations/results gathered or produced in the course of the investigation. It includes: 
•          complete solutions to all set tasks   set   out   in   a   clear   and   logical   way
•          appendices should only   be   used   if there are   extensive   repetitive   calculations   and   must   be   referenced   appropriately
•          all   results displayed appropriately and   clearly   (tables; graphs;   diagrams)
•          clear communication of all   relevant   information   (including correct   mathematical   notation)
•          interpretation and analysis of   all   results   using   complete   sentences
•          where applicable   reference should   be   made to the   reasonableness of the   results   (in terms   of the   context   of   the   problem   being   investigated)   and any   possible   limitations of the   interpreted   results/original   problem.
Conclusion
This section includes: 
•          a summary   of   all the   main findings
• a clear statement of the   overall   conclusion(s)/solution   (relating   directly   back to the   aim)
•          an evaluation of the   results and   methods   used,   including   a   comment   on   (where   applicable)
o   any assumptions   made and any   possible   limitations of the   interpreted   results
o   how the   investigation could   be extended to   provide further   results
o   what worked well and what didn’t   (in terms   of the   process   and   calculations)
o   any further   investigations that could   lead on from this one
Bibliography
•          all sources   used   must   be   included and   referenced appropriately.
